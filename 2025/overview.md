# EID103 - 2025

## Overview:

## Tools:
Hacksaw, 
Small electric drill (slow spinning), hex drive chuck for drill bits
Arbor Press
Files
3D printer


## Learning Objectives/Experiences:
1. CAD
    1. Making parts, assemblies
2. Designing rigid structures of weak materials
3. Rotational and Linear motion design fundamentals
4. Systems thinking
5. Narrative Development
6. Inter team communication
7. Design under many constraints

## Weeks:
### 1
1. CAD Onshape (basic sketching, feaatures [sweep loft], assembly mates, vesioning, collaboration)

### 2 
1. Iterative design, collaboration, design narrative (versioning). 

### 3
1. Design for Rapid Prototyping, 3D printing, seam placement, tolerancing, infill, perimeters, elephants foot/chamfering, GD&T regarding ID and OD tolerance from 3d printing errors, solution methods include xy comp in software, or manually adjust dims in CAD
2. Split into groups, give them final project official document.

### 4
1. Mechanial Advantage, rotational motion, linear motion, various mechanisms
    1. Simple machines (wedge, lever, pulley, wheel/axel)
    2. Positive locking mechanism, quick release mechanism, snap shackle
    2. Find 5 mechanisms in devices you see in your life
2. Send out form with confidence scale for each student (to help placing into groups)

### 5 (BIG LECTURE HALL (BOTH COME TOGETHER) )

1. Mathematical mechanical analysis of various mechanisms. Over center mechanism. Wedge. Ratchet and pawl.
    1. Apply a mathematical analysis to one of the mechanisms you found
    2. Levers

## Assignments:
1. Find an object that has gone through a design evolution over time.
    1. Year of change
    2. Material change and reasons for change
    3. A writeup about the evolution of the product. Important details.
    4. An ethical reflection on the evolution of the product
2. CAD a part Individually (something in the real world that fits the criteria for a mechanism)
3. CAD multiple parts that make an assembly of that mechanism
4. 3d print bearing fit plate (tolerancing) (extension for other members) any shape that needs to mate with the negative (friction fit)
5. Print gears with bearing features from last week but now feature to prevent bearing from pushing output

## Projects
1. Physical Motion Rectifier:
    1. Motor with sinewave power input
    2. Goal is to generate constant velocity output (as close as possible)
    3. Quantitative analysis of motor velocity when engaged and disengaged with rectifer mechanism
    4. Output is intermittent or linear motion intermittent or linear motion
    5. The mechanism must be able to be easily disconnected from the motor, but NOT removing the entire mechanism
    5. EC: Make the quick connect able to engage/disengage while the motor is spinning via a lever (think a stick shift transmission)
2. Automata w/ process video w/ narration and final report
    1. Constraints: Handcrank input, LxWxH (1'x1'x1')
    2. 2 unique mechanism in the automata
    3. Materials: Bearings (3mm, 5mm, 10mm), shafts (3,5,10mm)
    4. Weekly versioning of project with justification for work done
