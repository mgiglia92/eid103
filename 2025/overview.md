# EID103 - 2025

## Overview:

## Tools:
Hacksaw, 
Small electric drill (slow spinning), hex drive chuck for drill bits
Arbor Press
Files
3D printer


## Learning Objectives/Experiences:
1. CAD
    1. Making parts, assemblies
2. Designing rigid structures of weak materials
3. Rotational and Linear motion design fundamentals
4. Systems thinking
5. Narrative Development
6. Inter team communication
7. Design under many constraints

## Lessons:
1. CAD Onshape (basic sketching, feaatures [sweep loft], assembly mates, vesioning, collaboration)
2. Mechanial Advantage, rotational motion, linear motion, various mechanisms
    1. Simple machines (wedge, lever, pulley, wheel/axel)
    2. Find 5 mechanisms in devices you see in your life
3. Design for 3D printing, seam placement, tolerancing, infill, perimeters, elephants foot/chamfering, GD&T regarding ID and OD tolerance from 3d printing errors, solution methods include xy comp in software, or manually adjust dims in CAD
4. Mathematical mechanical analysis of various mechanisms. Over center mechanism. Wedge. Ratchet and pawl.
    1. Apply a mathematical analysis to one of the mechanisms you found
5. Iterative design, collaboration, design narrative (versioning). 

## Assignments:
1. CAD a part Individually (something in the real world that fits the criteria for a mechanism)
2. CAD multiple parts that make an assembly of that mechanism
3. 3d print bearing fit plate (tolerancing) (extension for other members) any shape that needs to mate with the negative (friction fit)
4. Print gears with bearing features from last week but now feature to prevent bearing from pushing output
5. 

## Projects
1. Physical Motion Rectifier:
    1. Motor with sinewave power input
    2. Goal is to generate constant velocity output (as close as possible)
    3. Quantitative analysis of motor velocity when engaged and disengaged with rectifer mechanism
    4. Output is intermittent or linear motion
2. Automata w/ process video w/ narration and final report
    1. Constraints: Handcrank input, LxWxH (1'x1'x1')
    2. 2 unique mechanism in the automata
    3. Materials: Bearings (3mm, 5mm, 10mm), shafts (3,5,10mm)
    4. Weekly versioning of project with justification for work done
