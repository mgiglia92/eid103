# Automata
[Mechanical Motion Consolidated] has been tasked with creating a kinetic sculpture device that displays an important social message. Since [Mechanical Motion Consolidated] is swamped with meetings for the mechanical rectifier project, they have decided to outsource the design and manufacture to you.


## Requirements
1. The sculpture must be powered by earth's gravatational field through a mass's potential energy
2. The sculpture must exploit the concept of Mechanical Advantage
3. There must be an element of intermittent motion
4. 

## Narrative development:

## Extra Credit:
Build your automata to have at least 1 positive or negative mechanical feedback loop. Show this feedback loop explicity in your systems diagram and explain how it is such.

Add an escapement mechanism to your sculpture.
