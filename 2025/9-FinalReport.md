# Final Report

The report for the Physical Motion Rectifier project requirements

## Main Discussions

1. Project description: What were you tasked with? IN DETAIL!
2. The engineering design process that your team went through. IN DETAIL! What tools did you use to aid in the design process? Discuss them.
3. An in depth analysis of YOUR DESIGN. 
    1. It is here that you are to also provide important context such that a non-technical reader would understand. For example, if your device uses mechanical advantage you MUST explain what mechanical advantage is. As well, simple and compound machines used in your device should be explained.
    2. Show your systems diagram and discuss what subsystems make up your system.
    3. Bill of Materials
    4. An exploded view of your assembly
    5. A regular view of your assembly
4. Outcome Analysis: You were given a task to make a constant output speed from a non-constant input power. Did your system achieve this? Show evidence/data that it did or did not. 
    1. Analyze the data and discuss reasons why it did or did not work.
    2. Graph the response of the system for the different frequencies and amplitudes you tested the system at. Explain these graphs. Make sure they're Titled and Labeled!
5. Future work: With the knowledge you have gained from doing the project what would you do differently? What would you do next? Why would these things make the system work / work better? Use first principles in your explanations.
6. Conclusion: Wrap up your report. Discuss what you've learned. Reflect on your successes and/or failures.
7. Be sure to put IMAGES, graphs, math expressions in your report. BE SURE TO LABEL EACH OF THESE THINGS!

## Deliverables

1. One ZIP file with the following (I will NOT accept a link to a file on OneDrive/GoogleDrive, nor will I accept a bunch of files handed in. You MUST deliver one ZIP file only)
    1. Your final report as a PDF file OR a MSDoc file.
        1. Naming Convention: Group#_GroupName_FinalReport.pdf
    2. Your digitzed journal entries over the course of the semester INSIDE a directory called "JournalEntries"
        1. Naming Convention: Group#_GroupName_IndividualName_JournalEntries.pdf
    3. Any supplemental videos or files
        1. Make sure this is in a directory called "SupplementalFiles"
    4. Use your organizational skills and your intuition to make suree the SupplementalFiles directory is ORGANIZED! Use a Naming Convention as well that is EASY TO FOLLOW!
