# Simple Machines and Mechanical Advantage

## Simple Machine
- WIKI: A simple machines is a mechanical device that changes the direction or magnitude of a force. Typically they use Mechanical Advantage to complete their task. Mechanical Advantage is another term for Leverage! As well, a SINGLE applied force is used to do work against a single LOAD force.

- An IDEAL simple machine can be thought of as a Mechanical Amplifier, where the GAIN of the amplifer is determined by geometric relationships on the simple machine. Unlike an eletronic amplifier though, the Power INTO the ideal simple machine must be equivalent to the Power OUT of the machine. In non-ideal cases, friction, energy storage elements and elasticity play into the loss of power transmitted through the simple machine. 


## Rotational Simple Machines

### Lever
- A lever consists of a "beam" or "link", and a rotational joint (called a fulcrum).
- The rotational joint is fixed in the linear degrees of freedom, but has one rotational DOF free.
- The three classes of levers just describe the relative configuration of the input force, output force and the fulcrum. Regardless of the lever class, the mechanical advantage calculations are the same. The input force can also be called the "effort" and the output force the "resistance or load".

- Show mechanical advantage equation for a lever.

- Levers can be chained together creating a "compound lever". NOTE: Gear trains can be thought of as compound levers! 

### Wheel and Axle
- Two circular objects that are fixed to one another. Typically the wheel is the larger circular element, and the axle the smaller. (I can't think of one where the wheel is smaller than the axel, but I'm sure it can't exist)
- Since these two circular elements are fixed to one another, this device can essentially be thought of as a lever! 
    - What is a significant difference between the lever and the wheel/axle?
        - The wheel and axle has the potential for continuous motion (> 2PI)
        - It may be the case that a lever can allow for continous motion, but typically a lever has limited motion. Why do you think the lever has limited motion compared to the wheel and axle? 

- **What features are needed for a wheel and axle to be realizable?**


### Pulley
- The pulley is essentially an "advanced" form of the wheel and axle. A pulley IS a wheel and axle but depending on the application the wheel and axle may be rotationally FREE or rotationally FIXED.

- Two main applications of a pulley:
1. A pulley may be used to aid in the lifting or motion of something by using a rope, belt, cable or chain. In this case, the input force would be applied to the rope like element. The pulley would then change the direction of this force to the load. In this case as well, the axle and pulley are rotationally free from one another allowing power transmission to the load directly through the rope.

2. Sometimes a pulley may just act as a energy transferring machine. For example taking rotational input power from a device and transmitting it to another rotational element. In this case the pulley is typically fixed to the axles so that power can be transmitted to the axle!
    - Some examples include an internal combustion engine.

3. Pulleys can be compounded to amplify their mechanical advantage. Typically this is done through a "block and tackle". A block is a set of pulleys mounted together on a single frame. When multiple blocks are used in tandem with a rope that passes through these blocks we call it a "tackle".

- Do 3 examples: Pulley with MA=1, Pulley with MA=2, Pulley with MA=4
- How can I make a pulley system with a MA=3?

## "Linear" Simple Machines

### Inclined Plane
- Various ways to setup input and output of an inclined plane.
    - Mass sliding down
    - Force squeezing inclined plane out
    - Force pushing inclined plane sideways forcing mass upwards
- Is this simple machine back drivable?

## Compound machines and/or Simple Mechanisms







## Homework

You have been given the task to design two compound machines. A compound machine is a system that uses at least 2 simple machines. Sketch two DIFFERENT compound machines. Determine the input and outputs of this machine and define the mechanical advantage. Make sure your sketch is well labelled with important angles, lengths, and forces shown! Provide a brief reasoning for your mechanical advantage expression as well as a use-case for your newly designed machine.
