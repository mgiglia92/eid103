## HW
1. Make 2 four bar linkages
    1. One has full motion
    2. One has limited motion
2. Disucuss why one of the configurations of the 4 bar linkage doesn't have full range of motion
3. Point out at least 2 problems that would arise in making this 4 bar linkage in real life
    1. Give an example of at least one potential solution for each of these problems.
