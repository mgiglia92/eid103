# CAD

## Variables
1. Defined vs Measured

## Sketching Concepts
1. Underdefined/Overdefined Sketches
2. Use of constraints
3. Using constraints to make symmetric geometry
4. Using constraints and dimensions to make updatable geometry

## Features
### Boss Extrude
1. Boss Extrude Solid (show that sometimes selected sketch can force extrude to default to surface)
2. New vs Add vs Remove vs Intersect
3. Blind vs Up to Face/Vertex
4. Show Symmetric Option
5. Show Draft Option

### Hole Feature
1. Using the hole feature to get properly sized holes and hole callouts in a drawing

## Configurations
1. Setting up a configuration
2. When would using a configuration be useful?
3. Using a variable for a configuration instead (for example, gear or any co-dependent parameters)
    1. Quick discussion of gears (module, pitch diameter, #teeth)
## Assembly
1. Inserting configurations
2. Fixing! (Show animation w/ and w/o fixing of base linke)
3. Revolute mate
4. Animation

## Misc
1. Versioning and Branching
2. Making derived parts
3. Rotational Pattern
    1. Be sure to constrain center point
4. Linear Pattern
5. Slot tool in sketch
6. Boolean
7. Reference Geometry
8. Rollback Bar

## In-class assignment
1. Find objects to model that would use each of the following and model each part (make up dimensions if necessary, keep the part simple!):
    1. Rotational Feature Pattern
    2. Linear Feature Pattern
    3. Mirror Feature/Part
2. Find a model on thingiverse and add or adjust a feature to improve or expand the capability 

## HW
1. Make 2 four bar linkages (input link configuration MUST be named INPUT_LINK)
    1. One has 360 deg of rotational freedom on input link
    2. One has less than 360 deg of rotational freedom on input link
2. Disucuss why one of the configurations of the 4 bar linkage doesn't have full range of motion
3. Point out at least 2 problems that would arise in realizing this 4 bar linkage
    1. Give an example of at least one potential solution for each of these problems.
    2. I can think of at least 3 regarding fastening and friction
